read errors from the robot send high level commands, such as goal positions and compliance. Try to turn on or off parts of the robot, or the whole robot.
You can also send commands to make the part moves. Give joints goal positions, express ** in degrees** in Reachy 2 coordinate system.
Have a look to the Arms kinematics page to know the sign of the angles to send to the joints.</description></item><item><title>Visualization tools</title><link>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/dashboard/content/visualization/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 15:46:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/dashboard/content/visualization/</guid><description>Foxglove #

Working with services has the advantage of having Reachy&amp;rsquo;s code running automatically at boot whithout needing to open a terminal and start it yourself. However using the services can make debugging the robot more difficult because the code running for Reachy is &amp;ldquo;hidden&amp;rdquo;, that is why we made this page.
Having this page is useful when something is going wrong with Reachy.</description></item><item><title>Network</title><link>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/dashboard/content/network/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 15:46:07 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/dashboard/content/network/</guid><description>The wifi page of the dashboard lets you handle the network connection of the robot and typically looks like the following:
There are four main elements on this page:
Connection card: this card will display whether Reachy is connected to the Internet with an ethernet cable or a wifi network (in which case it will tell you which wifi network) or if it is using its hotspot,
Wifi adder card: this card will help you connect Reachy to a wifi network.</description></item></channel></rss>
