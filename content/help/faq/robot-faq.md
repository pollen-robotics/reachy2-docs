<summary>I cannot connect my robot to the network with an ethernet cable
</summary>

## WiFi connection
On your first connection to a network, the simpliest is to connect your robot with an ethernet cable.  

If you cannot do so:

Use the appropriate cable and connect your computer directly to Reachy 2's computer. The cable has to be plugged in port (b) of Reachy 2's hardware interface.

We use `tio`for the serial connection. If you haven't installed it yet on your computer:
`apt install tio`

To check it: <br> <code>>>> groups</code> <br>If it doesn't appear in the list, add it with: <br><code>>>> sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER</code> <br>Then reboot your computer for the new group to be effective." >}}

Then, in a terminal on your computer, get access to the robot with:

```python
tio /dev/ttyUSB0
```

> Note that the connection could be on another USB port. Check all ports with `ls /dev/ttyUSB*`

Manually connect the robot to a WiFi with:
```bash
nmcli device wifi connect <wifi.name> password <your.password>
```

> For example, with the wifi *POLLEN-WIFI*, with password *superstrongpassword*:  
> `nmcli device wifi connect POLLEN-WIFI password superstrongpassword`

<summary>How to connect to my robot
</summary>

There are several ways to connect to your robot.

## SSH connection
Using the robot's IP address (check Find Reachy 2's IP if you don't know it), you can directly connect via ssh to Reachy 2's computer:

```python
ssh bedrock@<Reachy.2.IP.address>
```

> For example, with robot's IP being 192.168.1.42:
> ```python
> ssh bedrock@192.168.1.42
> ```

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="<b>Password: root</b>" >}}

## Avahi connection

Find the serial number of your robot on its back, connect your computer on the same network as your robot, open a terminal and type:
```bash
ping <robot.serial.number>.local
```

>For example, if the serial number is reachy2-beta1:
>```bash
>ping reachy2-beta1.local
>```

## Hard-wired connection

Use the appropriate cable and connect your computer directly to Reachy 2's computer. The cable has to be plugged in port (b) of Reachy 2's hardware interface.  

{{< img-center "images/docs/advanced/serial-connection.png" 500x "Serial connection port" >}}

We use `tio`for the serial connection. If you haven't installed it yet on your computer:
`apt install tio`

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Make sure <i>dialout</i> is in your groups, otherwise add it to your groups. To check it: <br> <code>>>> groups</code> <br>If it doesn't appear in the list, add it with: <br><code>>>> sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER</code> <br>Then reboot your computer for the new group to be effective." >}}

Once connected, open a terminal on your computer and run:
```python
tio /dev/ttyUSB0
```
*Note that depending on the elements you connected to the robot, the port could be something else than ttyUSB0. Check other available serial ports with `ls /dev/ttyUSB*`*

{{< img-center "images/docs/advanced/tio-terminal.png" 500x "Tio connection port" >}}

{{< alert icon="ðŸ‘‰" text="Login: <b>bedrock</b> <br>Password: <b>root</b>" >}}

You are then connected to Reachy 2 computer!

<summary>I want to modify the sound volume
</summary>

## Sound volume

If you want to change the volume, especially for the starting sound of your robot or the output sound when you teleoperate, you need to go on a terminal **when the webRTC service is running** : 

Run:
```console
$ ssh bedrock@your_robot_ip #password : root
$ docker exec -it webrtc_streaming_playback_ros bash
$ alsamixer -c 1 
```

Then, you can set the volume as you wish. 

</details>

## Problems with the motors 

Check all logs of the service with:

```bash
journalctl -b -u reachy2-core
```

## Problems with the sound or cameras

Check all logs of the service with:

If you are using the cameras with the Python SDK, the cameras are managed by the reachy2-core service.  
Check all logs of the service with:

```bash
journalctl -b -u reachy2-core
```

If you are using the teleoperation app, then check:

```bash
journalctl -b -u webrtc
```
