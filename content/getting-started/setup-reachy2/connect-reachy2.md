## B) Connect to the dashboard

Check the name of your robot at its back and type it followed with **.local:8000** in your web browser.  

> Example: for a robot called `reachy2-pvt00`, type **`reachy2-pvt00.local:8000`** in your web browser

You can also connect to the dashboard via Reachy‚Äôs IP address.  
Connect the LCD screen provided to the USB port on the mobile base (this must be done before starting the robot). Reachy‚Äôs IP address will appear.  
Open a tab in your web browser and enter Reachy's IP adress followed with **:8000**.  

> Example: for a robot with IP `192.168.0.100`, type **`192.168.0.100:8000`** in your web browser

**Click on ‚ÄúReachy awake‚Äù to confirm that Reachy is well set-up.**
