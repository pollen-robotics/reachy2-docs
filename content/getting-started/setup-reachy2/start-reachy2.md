## A) Start the Mobile Base

<br />
Press the mobile base button (next to the mobile baseâ€™s LCD screen).

<br />


Make sure Reachy is in the correct position, with its head straight, arms at its sides, and wrists straight (as shown in the photo).

Then press and turn the emergency stop button clockwise to raise it. The automatic calibration process will start.

## C) Turn on Reachyâ€™s Computer

Press the button located on Reachyâ€™s back. It takes up to 2 minutes for the computer to start. You will hear a little bubbly sound when Reachy is ready.

{{< alert icon="ðŸ”Œ" text="We advise unplugging the computer after each use for power saving, because the USB ports still consume current when the computer is off." >}}
