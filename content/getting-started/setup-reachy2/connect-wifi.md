## WiFi

On your first connection to a network, the simplest method is to connect your robot with an Ethernet cable.  

If you cannot do this:

Use the appropriate cable and connect your computer directly to Reachy 2's computer. The cable must be plugged into port (b) of Reachy 2's hardware interface.

We use `tio` for the serial connection. If you haven't installed it yet on your computer:
```bash
apt install tio
```

To check it: <br> <code>>>> groups</code> <br>If it doesn't appear in the list, add it with: <br><code>>>> sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER</code> <br>Then reboot your computer for the new group to be effective." >}}

Then, in a terminal on your computer, access the robot with:

```bash
tio /dev/ttyUSB0
```

> Note: The connection could be on another USB port. Check all ports with:
> ```bash
> ls /dev/ttyUSB*
> ```

Manually connect the robot to a WiFi network with:
```bash
nmcli device wifi connect <wifi.name> password <your.password>
```

> For example, with the WiFi *POLLEN-WIFI* and password *superstrongpassword*:  
> ```bash
> nmcli device wifi connect POLLEN-WIFI password superstrongpassword
> ```
