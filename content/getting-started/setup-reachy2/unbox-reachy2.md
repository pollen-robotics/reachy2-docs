## A) Remove Reachy and its accessories out of the box

Reachy will arrive in a big box. Be sure to be at least 4 people to safely lift the robot out of the box, and a crowbar to open the box. Cut the firewall fabric with a pair of scissors. Remove Reachy and its accessories out of the box. You should have:

- Printed user guide, safety guidelines and invoice
- Battery charger
- Mini USB cable
- LCD screen kit
- Emergency stop button
- 2 plastic pieces for placing the emergency button

## B) Lift the robot out of the box

Hold down the mobile base and ask someone to unscrew all pods (not too much, 90° should be enough), and lift the robot’s torso to adjust the height. Make sure Reachy’s head is straight and arms are far from the tripod.
