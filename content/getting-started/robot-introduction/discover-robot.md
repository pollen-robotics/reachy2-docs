## ü§ñ Meet Reachy 2

**Reachy 2** is a versatile, expressive, and open robotic platform designed to explore the future of **human-robot interaction**, **assistive robotics**, and **AI-driven behaviors**.

{{< youtube T3RdwDkZA9c >}}
<br>

It combines the **dexterity of a humanoid upper body**, the **mobility of a holonomic base**, and a rich set of **sensors**‚Äîincluding stereo vision, microphones, a speaker, lidar, and more. Whether you want to build an expressive assistant, a teleoperated avatar, or a robot that learns from demonstration, Reachy 2 gives you the tools to make it happen.


### What makes Reachy 2 unique?

- **Human-like form** with articulated arms, head, and antennas for expressive motion  
- **Mobile base** with omnidirectional movement for smooth, precise navigation  
- **Sensor-rich**: cameras, microphones, lidar, IMUs, and more  
- **ROS 2-powered**, but also accessible via a high-level Python SDK  
- **Modular and open**, so you can extend, adapt, and customize it for your needs


> **Object manipulation in the real world is the next frontier.**
>
>Truly useful robots need to learn how to interact with the physical world:  
>‚úîÔ∏è Picking up everyday objects  
>‚úîÔ∏è Helping in a workspace or home  
>‚úîÔ∏è Performing tasks with purpose and adaptability  
>
>Manipulation is the bridge between motion and meaningful action.
>
>üí™ **Reachy 2 is built for this challenge**  
>- Its 7-DOF arms mimic the shape, proportions, and range of motion of a human arm
>- It can lift objects up to 3 kg, making it capable of interacting with real, everyday items
>- Its gripper, head, cameras, and sensors combine to create a fully interactive system
>- And with VR teleoperation or Python-based control, you‚Äôre in command‚Äîwhether you want to guide it live or program intelligent behaviors


### What can you do with it?

With Reachy 2, you can:
- Control the robot in real time or via code  
- Create movement sequences and animations  
- Use vision, speech, or lidar to react to the environment  
- Record, replay, and synchronize multimodal behaviors  
- Explore telepresence, assistance, and autonomous decision-making
