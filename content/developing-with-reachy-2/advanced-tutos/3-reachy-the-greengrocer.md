In this [tutorial](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy2-tutorials/blob/main/3_Reachy_the_greengrocer.ipynb), we will ask Reachy to sort fruits on a table and to drop them in user-defined places, according to which fruit it is.

What you will learn :

- How to do object detection
- How to switch from the image frame to the robot frame
- How to make Reachy move according to what it sees
