In [this tutorial](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy2-tutorials/blob/main/2_Reachy_the_mime.ipynb),  we will transform Reachy into a mime who pulls an invisible rope.



What you will learn :

- How to use the **mobile base**,
- How to **synchronize** arms and mobile base movements,
- How and when to use **blocking** gotos,
- How to follow a particular **trajectory** with the end effector.
