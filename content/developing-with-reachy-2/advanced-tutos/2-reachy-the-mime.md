  title: "Tutorial: Turn Reachy 2 Into a Mime â€“ Synchronize Arms and Mobile Base"
  description: "Learn how to program Reachy 2 to mimic pulling an invisible rope! This tutorial teaches you to coordinate arm and mobile base movements, use blocking gotos, and follow precise end-effector trajectories."
---

In [this tutorial](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy2-tutorials/blob/main/notebooks/2_Reachy_the_mime.ipynb),  we will transform Reachy into a mime who pulls an invisible rope.



What you will learn :

- How to use the **mobile base**,
- How to **synchronize** arms and mobile base movements,
- How and when to use **blocking** gotos,
- How to follow a particular **trajectory** with the end effector.
