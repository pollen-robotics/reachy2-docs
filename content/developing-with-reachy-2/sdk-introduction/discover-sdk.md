## 🤖 Welcome to the Reachy 2 SDK

The **Reachy 2 SDK** is the easiest and most intuitive way to **program behaviors** for your Reachy 2 robot.

It’s built to help you:
- control Reachy’s **arms**, **head**, **gripper**, and **mobile base**,
- access its **sensors**, like cameras, lidar, and microphones,
- and create rich, expressive, and interactive behaviors with Python.

Whether you want to perform simple movements, play sounds, track an object, or design complex human-robot interactions, the SDK gives you a **high-level and accessible interface** to do it all.

### 👤 Who is this SDK for?

- If you’re just starting with Reachy 2, the SDK is your **go-to entry point**.  

- If you’re a developer, designer, educator, or researcher looking to create interactive robot behaviors—this SDK was made with you in mind.  

- And if you're an advanced robotics user, don't worry: **Reachy 2 is powered by ROS 2** under the hood. You can always tap into the full ROS ecosystem for deeper customization, real-time communication, and integration with other systems.
