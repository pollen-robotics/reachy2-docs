Before you can start sending commands or running code, you need to **connect to your Reachy 2**. Here‚Äôs how to get set up:

## Step 1 ‚Äî Be on the same network

üåê To communicate with Reachy 2, your computer and the robot must be **on the same network**. You can do this:
- via **Ethernet** (recommended for stability), or
- via **WiFi** (if both devices are on the same WiFi network).

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important if using ethernet:**
Do not plug an Ethernet cable directly between your computer and the robot.
Instead, connect the robot‚Äôs Ethernet cable to your router or switch, so it becomes part of your local network‚Äîjust like your computer.

## Step 2 ‚Äî Find Reachy‚Äôs IP address

You‚Äôll need the robot‚Äôs IP address to connect using the SDK.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: You can‚Äôt use the *`*.local`* hostname to connect with the SDK‚Äîyou‚Äôll need the actual IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.42`).

There are two ways to find it:

### Option 1: Using the dashboard

Open a browser on your computer (on the same network as the robot), and goto `reachy_name.local:8000/`.

Once you are in the dashboard, you can click on **Network** and you will find the IP addresses of your robot (WiFi and Ethernet). 

### Option 2: Using the LCD screen

If you are not able to access the dashboard, you can turn off completely your robot. Then, you can plug the supplied LCD screen on the USB port of the mobile base.

Turn on your robot again, and it should display display the robot's IP addresses (alternately Ethernet and WiFi) :

## Step 3 ‚Äî Connect!

Once you‚Äôve got the IP, you‚Äôre ready to connect using the SDK!  
You can check that everything is working as expected by running the following Python code in a terminal on your virtual environment :

```
$ python3
from reachy2_sdk import ReachySDK

# Replace with the actual IP you've found.
reachy = ReachySDK(host='the.reachy.ip.found.')
```
