> You can choose to follow our online documentation or directly test the mobile base movements on your Reachy by following the [notebook n¬∞5](https://github.com/pollen-robotics/reachy2-sdk/blob/develop/src/examples/5_mobile_base.ipynb). 

## Mobile base presentation
The following elements are accessible through *reachy.mobile_base*:
* Battery level
* Odometry of the base
* Lidar
* Control and drive modes *(not detailed here)*
* `goto`, `translate_by`, `rotate_by`, and `set_speed` methods to make the mobile base move.

### Information

You can find details by calling the `mobile_base` attribute directly:
```python
reachy.mobile_base
>>> <MobileBase on=True 
 lidar_safety_enabled=True 
 battery_voltage=26.3>
```

#### battery_voltage

The battery voltage can be directly accessed using `reachy.mobile_base.battery_voltage`.

```python
reachy.mobile_base.battery_voltage
>>> 26.3
```

### Sensors

The mobile contains a **Lidar sensor**, accessible with:
```python3
reachy.mobile_base.lidar
>>> <Lidar safety_enabled=True>
```

This Lidar is responsible for **object detection**, and offers a **safety** to avoid collision.  
The Lidar features are detailed in the dedicated [Lidar section]({{< ref "developing-with-reachy-2/basics/6-use-mobile-base#lidar" >}}).

## Frames

Understanding coordinate frames is essential when working with mobile robots, as they define how positions and orientations are interpreted and transformed.

Reachy 2‚Äôs mobile base operates using two main reference frames:
1. The **robot frame**, which moves with the robot and defines its egocentric perspective.
2. The **odom frame**, which represents a fixed world reference used to estimate the robot‚Äôs global position over time.

These frames follow standard robotics conventions and are crucial for tasks like navigation, localization, and trajectory planning.

Let‚Äôs take a closer look at each of them:

### Robot frame
The robot frame, also called the egocentric or `base_link` frame, is **rigidly attached to the robot**. Its (0, 0) point is the projection on the floor of the center of the mobile base.
**X points forward, Y points left, and Theta increases counterclockwise.**

{{< img-center "images/sdk/mobile-base/robot_frame.png" 400x "" >}}

*It follows ROS' conventions described in [REP 105 ‚ÄúCoordinate Frames for Mobile Platforms‚Äù](https://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html)*

### Odom frame
The odom frame is a **world-fixed frame**. The position (x, y, theta) of the robot in the odom frame is continuously updated through odometry calculations. These calculations currently rely solely on wheel measurements to estimate the robot's movement. While the robot's position is continuous, **it should never be used as a long-term reference due to inevitable drift.**  

{{< img-center "images/sdk/mobile-base/odom_frame.png" 400x "" >}}

### Resetting the Odom frame
The initial position of the odom frame matches the robot's position at startup. The odom frame can be reset at anytime to the robot's current position using:
```python
reachy_mobile.mobile_base.reset_odometry()
```

After this call, the robot‚Äôs current position becomes the new origin `(0, 0, 0)` of the odom frame.

---

## Mobile base goto methods

### goto()

#### Goto target
The mobile base's **`goto()`** method moves to a specified position and orientation within **[odom frame]({{< ref "/developing-with-reachy-2/basics/6-use-mobile-base#odom-frame" >}})**. The expected target contains three elements:  
- `x` (meters)
- `y` (meters)
- `theta` (degrees)

A simple `goto()` command on the mobile base will look like:
```python
reachy.mobile_base.goto(x=0.2, y=0, theta=20)
```

:warning: **Important:** The odom frame is world-fixed, and the robot's position is continuously updated as long as the HAL is running (the HAL starts automatically when the robot boots). By default, **if you ask for a `goto(0, 0, 0)`, the robot will attempt to return to its position at boot-up.**

To perform a `goto()` relative to the robot's current position, use the `reset_odometry()` method before sending the command.  

To get a better grasp of how `goto()` behaves, follow the examples below‚Äîstarting by instantiating your robot:

```python
from reachy2_sdk import ReachySDK

reachy = ReachySDK(host='your-reachy-ip')
reachy.mobile_base.turn_on()
```

---

**ü¶æ Example 1: Moving forward by 50 cm**

Reset the odometry frame and move the robot 50 cm forward:
```python
reachy.mobile_base.reset_odometry()
reachy.mobile_base.goto(x=0.5, y=0.0, theta=0.0)
```

**What it does:**  
- `reset_odometry()` sets the current position as the origin (0, 0, 0) in the odom frame.
- The `goto()` command moves the robot 0.5 meters forward from this new origin.

Now, request `goto(0, 0, 0)`. The robot will return to its previous position:
```python
reachy_mobile.mobile_base.goto(x=0.0, y=0.0, theta=0.0)
```

---

**ü¶æ Example 2: Sequential movements without resetting odometry**

```python
# Move 30cm forward, to reach x=30cm
reachy.mobile_base.goto(x=0.3, y=0.0, theta=0.0)

# Go back by 10cm, to reach x=20cm
reachy.mobile_base.goto(x=0.2, y=0.0, theta=0.0)
```

**What it does:**  
- The first `goto()` moves the robot to `x=0.3` in the odom frame.
- The second `goto()` moves the robot to x=0.2 in the same frame, effectively moving it **backward by 10 cm**..

---

**ü¶æ Example 3: Sequential movements with odometry reset**

Let's do the same by resetting the odometry between the two commands:
```
import time

# Move 30cm forward, to reach x=30cm in the current odometry frame
reachy.mobile_base.goto(x=0.3, y=0.0, theta=0.0, wait=True)
time.sleep(0.2)

# Reset odometry to set the current position as the new origin
reachy.mobile_base.reset_odometry()
time.sleep(0.2)

# Move 20cm forward, to reach x=20cm in the new current odometry frame
reachy.mobile_base.goto(x=0.2, y=0.0, theta=0.0)
```

**What it does:**  
- The robot moves to `x=0.3` in the original odom frame.
- `reset_odometry()` sets this new position as the origin `(0, 0, 0)`.
- The subsequent `goto()` moves the robot 0.2 meters forward from this new origin, reaching `x=0.5` in the original odom frame.

---

> We recommend experimenting with this concept to get familiar.


#### Goto parameters
Unlike the arms or head, where movement duration is explicitly defined using a duration parameter, the mobile base's `goto()` timing behavior is governed by `tolerances`, `timeouts`, and the optional `wait` flag.

These parameters give you fine control over how and when a goto() is considered finished.

##### Tolerances
Tolerances define **how close** the robot must be to the goal before the motion is considered finished.
- **distance_tolerance** *(float, in meters)*  
The maximum distance allowed between the robot‚Äôs current `(x, y)` position and the target to consider the `goto()` completed.  
‚Üí Default: `0.05` meters (5 cm)

- **angle_tolerance** *(float, in degrees by default)*  
The maximum allowed angular difference to the target `theta` before the motion is considered complete.  
‚Üí Default: `5.0` degrees

These tolerances do **not stop the motion**. They simply raise the internal flag that the `goto()` has "finished"‚Äîwhich is particularly useful when **chaining multiple gotos**.  
- If **other `goto()` commands are queued**, the mobile base will **immediately switch to the next one** as soon as the flag is raised.
- Even after the movement is marked as done, **if no other command is queued**, the robot **continues moving** to get closer to the target.

---

##### Timeout

- **timeout** *(float)*  
The timeout parameter provides a way to **cap the maximum duration** of a `goto()` command for the mobile base. It defines how long the robot should keep trying to reach the target before **aborting the motion**.  
‚Üí Default timeout: 100 seconds

This is useful to avoid indefinitely waiting when something obstructs the robot or the target is unreachable.

**What timeout does**
- If the robot **reaches the target (within tolerances)** before the timeout, the movement ends normally.
- If the **timeout is reached before the goal is achieved**, the `goto()` is **interrupted**, and the **robot immediately stops**.
- This is different from tolerances: **timeouts also stop the physical movement**, whereas tolerances only determine when the motion is *considered* finished (but the robot may keep adjusting its position afterward).

---

##### Wait

The wait parameter does work like for the other parts, `wait=True` will make the function **blocking**.
The `goto()` will return only when the motion is *considered* finished (based on tolerances or timeout).

---

#### Examples of mobile base's goto() usage

Here‚Äôs a commented set of examples that demonstrate how to use the `goto()` function with Reachy 2‚Äôs mobile_base, covering various use cases and parameters like `wait`, `tolerances`, `timeout`, and chaining behavior.

---

**ü¶æ Example 1: Basic movement with wait=True**

```python
# Move forward 50 cm and wait until the movement is finished
reachy.mobile_base.goto(x=0.5, y=0.0, theta=0.0, wait=True)
```
This is the simplest way to send a motion command and wait for it to complete.

---

**ü¶æ Example 2: Basic use with larger tolerance**

```python
# Move forward to x = 0.6m, with 20cm tolerance
reachy.mobile_base.goto(x=0.6, y=0.0, theta=0.0, distance_tolerance=0.2, wait=True)

odom_goto_end = reachy.mobile_base.odometry
print("Odometry when goto is declared as finished:")
print(f"x: {round(odom_goto_end['x'], 3)}")

time.sleep(1)  # Give time for final adjustments

odom_after_motion = reachy.mobile_base.odometry
print("Odometry after the motion has fully finished:")
print(f"x: {round(odom_after_motion['x'], 3)}")
```

Even though the motion was **flagged as complete** once within 20 cm of the target, the robot **kept adjusting its position**, as no other `goto()` command is queued.

---

**ü¶æ Example 3: Chaining gotos with default tolerances**

```python
goto1 = reachy.mobile_base.goto(x=0.0, y=0.0, theta=0.0)
goto2 = reachy.mobile_base.goto(x=0.6, y=0.0, theta=0.0)
goto3 = reachy.mobile_base.goto(x=-0.2, y=0.0, theta=0.0)
goto4 = reachy.mobile_base.goto(x=0.3, y=0.0, theta=0.0)

# Wait for each motion to finish before logging odometry
for i, goto in enumerate([goto1, goto2, goto3, goto4], start=1):
    while not reachy.is_goto_finished(goto):
        time.sleep(0.05)
    odom = reachy.mobile_base.odometry
    print(f"Odometry after goto{i}: x={round(odom['x'], 3)}")
```

With the default `distance_tolerance=0.05`, the odometry will be quite close to the requested target after each `goto()` is marked as finished.

---

**ü¶æ Example 4: Chaining gotos with larger tolerances**

Let's use the same targets as Example 3, but with larger tolerances:
```python
goto1 = reachy.mobile_base.goto(x=0.0, y=0.0, theta=0.0, distance_tolerance=0.1)
goto2 = reachy.mobile_base.goto(x=0.6, y=0.0, theta=0.0, distance_tolerance=0.3)
goto3 = reachy.mobile_base.goto(x=-0.2, y=0.0, theta=0.0, distance_tolerance=0.3)
goto4 = reachy.mobile_base.goto(x=0.3, y=0.0, theta=0.0, distance_tolerance=0.1)

for i, goto in enumerate([goto1, goto2, goto3, goto4], start=1):
    while not reachy.is_goto_finished(goto):
        time.sleep(0.05)
    odom = reachy.mobile_base.odometry
    print(f"Odometry after goto{i}: x={round(odom['x'], 3)}")
```

With these **larger tolerances**, each `goto()` will be considered finished earlier, meaning the robot switches to the next motion **before reaching the exact target**. This may result in less accurate stopping points, but faster chaining.

---

**ü¶æ Example 5: Forcing a stop after a short timeout**

```python
# Move back to base position
reachy.mobile_base.goto(x=0.0, y=0.0, theta=0.0, wait=True)

# Attempt to reach a target, but force stop after 0.5 seconds
reachy.mobile_base.goto(x=0.4, y=0.0, theta=90.0, timeout=0.5)
```

In this example:
- The robot starts turning and moving forward.
- After 0.5 seconds, the timeout triggers.
- The robot **stops**, even if it hasn‚Äôt reached the target or tolerances.

---

### translate_by() / rotate_by()

Unlike the goto() method, which operates in the [odom frame]({{< ref "developing-with-reachy-2/basics/6-use-mobile-base#odom-frame" >}}) ‚Äî a world-fixed frame ‚Äî the translate_by() and rotate_by() methods perform movements relative to the robot‚Äôs current position and orientation.  

This means commands are interpreted in the [robot frame]({{< ref "developing-with-reachy-2/basics/6-use-mobile-base#robot-frame" >}}), which moves with the robot.

> ‚öôÔ∏è These methods behave like `goto()`, including support for parameters like `wait`, `tolerances`, and `timeout`, but operate in a **local reference frame instead of a global one**.

Since these methods operate in the robot‚Äôs own frame, there is **no need to reset odometry** beforehand.

**ü¶æ Example: Rotate and move forward**
```python
# Rotate the robot by +90¬∞ (counterclockwise)
reachy.mobile_base.rotate_by(theta=90)

# Then move forward 30 cm in the new orientation
reachy.mobile_base.translate_by(x=0.3, y=0.0, wait=True)
```

**What it does**  
After rotating, the robot moves 30 cm **in the direction it‚Äôs now facing**.  


#### Goto-Based Functions

These functions compute the **necessary position and orientation** in the odom frame behind the scenes and send the appropriate **`goto()` command** for you.  

Both `translate_by()` and `rotate_by()` are goto-based functions. This means:
- They follow the same internal mechanisms as `goto()`
- They are **stackable**: you can queue multiple motions
- They are **cancelable**: you can interrupt them using the appropriate cancel method
- They support most standard mobile base's `goto()` parameters

**Important notes on relative behavior**  
Like for the other parts, these motions are computed relative to the goal of the most recent `goto()` command ‚Äî whether that command is currently executing or is queued.

If no `goto()` command is playing, the movement will be computed relative to the robot's current pose.


**‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Effect of cancelled goto**  
If the last `goto()` command is canceled after being issued, any subsequent `translate_by()` or `rotate_by()` calls will still compute their motion based on the original target of the canceled command, not the actual robot position and orientation at cancellation time or the previous `goto()`.  
This means:
- The computed motion remains unchanged even if the prior `goto()` was interrupted.
- The final pose will still be relative to the intended (but not reached) target of that canceled movement.  


## Mobile base set_goal_speed()
Since Reachy 2's mobile base is holonomic, it can move in any direction and rotate simultaneously. The `set_goal_speed()` method allows you to command such motion by specifying velocities in the **[robot frame]({{< ref "developing-with-reachy-2/basics/6-use-mobile-base#robot-frame" >}})**:
- **`x_vel`** - Linear speed in m/s along the X-axis (positive forward).
- **`y_vel`** - Linear speed in m/s along the Y-axis (positive left).
- **`rot_vel`** - Angular speed in deg/s (positive counterclockwise).

**You must call `send_speed_command()` to actually apply the speed to the mobile base.**

**ü¶æ Example: Send a goal speed to the mobile base**
```python
# Set the desired velocity (0.5 m/s forward, 20 deg/s rotation)
reachy.mobile_base.set_goal_speed(x=0.5, y=0.0, theta=20.0)

# Send the command
reachy.mobile_base.send_speed_command()
```

When using `set_goal_speed()` with `send_speed_command()`, the commanded speeds are **maintained for only 200 ms**.

> :bulb: If no new speed command is received within this time window, the robot will **automatically stop**.

This built-in safety feature ensures that the robot won‚Äôt keep moving indefinitely in case of a control loop crash, network drop, or software error.

To maintain continuous movement, you need to send updated speed commands at **regular intervals (e.g., every 100‚Äì150 ms)**.


<details id="mobile-base-ros2">
<summary><b>Advanced use (ROS 2) </b></summary>

The HAL implementation:  
- listens to the standard `/cmd_vel` topic
- applies smoothing
- performs kinematic calculations
- send speed commands to the wheels  
<br>

This makes it easy to create control interfaces using ROS.

*Note: The HAL includes a drive mode for speed commands with variable durations. While it creates a service instead of relying on a topic, the niche use case did not warrant SDK integration. However, it exists if needed!*

## Read mobile base position and speed

You can access the current estimated position and velocity of Reachy 2's mobile base using the `get_current_odometry()` function:
```python
reachy.mobile_base.get_current_odometry()
>>> {'x': 0.0018306385027244687,
 'y': 0.0533282645046711,
 'theta': -7.456543983885954,
 'vx': 0.0,
 'vy': 0.0,
 'vtheta': 0.0}
```

**Position (`x`, `y`, `theta`)**:  
These values represent the estimated pose of the **robot frame (`base_link`) within the odom frame**.
- `x`, `y`: position in meters
- `theta`: orientation in degrees (increasing counterclockwise)  

*See the [odom frame section]({{< ref "developing-with-reachy-2/basics/6-use-mobile-base#odom-frame" >}}) to better understand how to read the position.*

**Velocity (`vx`, `vy`, `vtheta`)**:  
These values represent the **instantaneous linear and angular velocities of the robot**, but they are expressed in the **robot frame** (not the odom frame).
- `vx`: forward speed (in m/s, along the robot‚Äôs X-axis)
- `vy`: lateral speed (in m/s, along the robot‚Äôs Y-axis)
- `vtheta`: angular velocity (in deg/s, around the robot‚Äôs Z-axis)

*See the [robot frame section]({{< ref "developing-with-reachy-2/basics/6-use-mobile-base#robot-frame" >}}) to better understand how to read the velocity.*

## Lidar

Reachy 2's mobile base includes a built-in **safety mechanism** using its Lidar sensor to **prevent collisions with nearby obstacles**.

This system automatically:
- **Slows down** the mobile base when an obstacle is detected within a warning range.
- **Stops** movement completely if an obstacle is too close (in the direction of the obstacle).

This allows for safer navigation in dynamic environments without requiring user-side obstacle avoidance.

### Disabling Lidar safety (Not recommended)

If your use case requires the robot to approach very close to objects, you can disable this safety layer:
```python
reachy.mobile_base.lidar.safety_enabled = False
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Use with caution. Once disabled, **the robot will no longer stop for obstacles and may collide with them**.  

To re-enable the feature:
```python
reachy.mobile_base.lidar.safety_enabled = True
```

### Configuring safety distances

Two thresholds control the behavior of the safety system:
- **`safety_slowdown_distance`** *(float, in meters)*:  
When an obstacle is within this distance, the robot begins to **slow down**.

- **`safety_critical_distance`** *(float, in meters)*:  
When an obstacle is closer than this distance, movement **in the direction of the obstacle is completely blocked**.

You can read or modify them like this:

```python
# Check current distances
print(reachy.mobile_base.lidar.safety_slowdown_distance)
print(reachy.mobile_base.lidar.safety_critical_distance)

# Set custom values
reachy.mobile_base.lidar.safety_slowdown_distance = 0.5  # 50 cm
reachy.mobile_base.lidar.safety_critical_distance = 0.2  # 20 cm
```

To **reset the safety distances to their default values**, use:

```python
reachy.mobile_base.lidar.reset_safety_default_distances()
```

Congratulations! You now know all the basics of Reachy's SDK! Let's move on to implementing complex behaviors! 

### Getting the Lidar map

The `get_map()` method retrieves a 2D image representation of the environment built from the Lidar data.

```python
lidar_map = reachy.mobile_base.lidar.get_map()
```

It returns the current map as an RGB image.

> No map is available in FAKE mode.
