## In brief

> The button names used below are for the Meta Quest headsets. Please refer to the Controllers input page to get the corresponding inputs for your device.

### Start teleoperating Reachy

1. Make sure the robot is turned on, connected to the network and that all the robot's services are running before launching the teleoperation application.

2. Select the robot you want to teleoperate (or create a new one), and click on "Connect".

3. Once in the mirror room, you can configure various settings. Take time to tune the motion sickness effects you want to use in the settings menu. When you are ready to start, press "Ready", then hold (A).

4. **Look straight ahead, with your body in the same orientation as your head while pressing A** to start the teleoperation. *The initial head position is used to determine the coordinate system giving your VR controllers position.* 

{{< alert icon="👉" text="<b>Warning:</b> you <b>must not move your body</b> anymore after this step. The position of your VR controllers to master the robot arms are calculated depending on the position you had while pressing A." >}}

{{< warning icon="🚨" text="<b>Important:</b> even if Reachy is bio-inspired, it cannot reproduce exactly all your movements. There are <b>positions that cannot be reached</b> by the robot. Please <b>avoid unusual movements</b> and do not persist in trying to reach a position if you see that the robot is stuck before it." >}}

5. (NEW) You first have the control of the head and the mobile base, but **not of the arms**. Take a few seconds to check the robot surroundings and go to an appropriate place before starting the full teleoperation. When the environment is safe, **press A** to get the full control. You can also go back to the mirror room pressing the related button with your laser beam.

6. Come back any time to mirror room by **holding A**. Teleoperation of the robot is automatically paused if the headset is removed.

{{< alert icon="👉" text="Please <b>stop teleoperation before removing your headset</b> (go back to mirror room or quit the app). If you do not, Reachy will continue following your controllers and headset orientation during a few seconds, and this can cause damages to the robot." >}}

### Stop teleoperation

1. Come back to the **mirror room** to pause the teleoperation by **holding A** at any time during teleoperation.  

2. Leave the app by clicking "**Quit**" icons in the mirror room and connection menu. 

The motors are automatically turned into compliant mode when quitting the mirror room. Please make sure the arms are close enough to the lowest position they can reach when coming back to the menu to avoid them falling or hitting something.  


## Step-by-step starting
1. Make sure that your VR equipement is up and running. Please refer to your device documentation.

2. Make sure the robot is turned on, connected to the network and that all the robot services are running. *By default, if you haven't modified anything, all services should be automatically launched on start of the **full/starter kit** robots.*

3. Launch the application *TeleoperateReachy.exe* file if you are using a VR device connected to a Windows computer. For Oculus Quest users, start the app from within the headset if you have installed the *.apk*.

4. Equip yourself with your headset, make sure you can see both controllers and that the scene around you is moving correctly in accordance with your head movements.

5. Choose the robot you want to connect to: you can select a robot with its IP address, or add a new one to the list of available robots.

{{< img "images/vr/use-teleop/select-robot.png" 600x "Select robot to connect">}}

6. Press *Connect* to initiate the communication with the robot.

{{< img "images/vr/use-teleop/connect.png" 600x "Connect to a robot">}}  </br>

7. You should be now in the *transition room*, and see yourself controlling a virtual reachy. The actual robot is not in control at that time but the live camera stream is displayed at the top right of the mirror. The info, help and settings menus are available here (they are documented in the next section). Please get familiar with the robot controls and features (emotion, grasping lock).

{{< img "images/vr/use-teleop/mirror.png" 600x "Mirror scene">}}  </br>

8. When you are ready, **face the mirror completely** and click on "Ready". The position of the actual robot appears in a semi-transparent green color. This may be useful when you've left the robot in a certain position that you would like to keep when entering the teleoperation. Hold (A) to start the teleoperation.

{{< img "images/vr/use-teleop/mirror-ready.png" 600x "Start teleoperation">}}  </br>

9. (NEW) You first have the control of the head and the mobile base, but **not of the arms**. Take a few seconds to check the robot surroundings and go to an appropriate place before starting the full teleoperation. When the environment is safe, **press A** to get the full control. You can also go back to the mirror room pressing the related button with your laser beam.

10. A 3 seconds timer appears while you enter the teleoperation. The motors speeds are reduced during this time to avoid sudden movements of the robot. Full speed is reached at the end of this countdown.

{{< img "images/vr/use-teleop/timer-start.png" 600x "Validate position before starting">}}

{{< alert icon="👉" text="<b>Warning:</b> you <b>don't want to move your torso and body</b> anymore after this step. Only your head and arms. The position of your VR controllers to master the robot arms are calculated depending on the position you had while pressing A." >}}

11. Come back any time to menu by **pressing A**. Teleoperation of the robot is automatically paused if the headset is removed.
