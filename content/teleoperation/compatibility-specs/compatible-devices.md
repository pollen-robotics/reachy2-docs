# Compatible VR headsets

So far, the VR teleoperation application has been tested with the following devices:
* **Meta Quest 2** (with Oculus Link)
* **Meta Quest 3** (with Oculus Link)

> No native application for Meta Quest headsets has been released at the moment.


The application should also support any device compatible with Unity 2022.3 including but not limited to the following devices:  
* **Valve Index**
* **HTC Vive**
* **Oculus Rift**


Please refer to [Unity documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.3/Documentation/Manual/VROverview.html) for more information about the compatibility.

# PC requirements


The application is built on Unity 2022.3 LTS for which the requirements can be found [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.3/Documentation/Manual/system-requirements.html).


In order to use the desktop version of the teleoperation application, your PC needs to support Virtual Reality. We recommend the computer to run on Windows, to be powerful enough and equipped with a graphic card.  

The computer minimum requirements are the following:  
* **Operating System:** Windows 10 (or Windows 7 SP1)
* **Processor:** Intel Core i5-4590/AMD FX 8350 equivalent or better
* **Memory:** 8GB RAM
* **Graphic card:** NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970, AMD Radeon R9 290 equivalent or better
* **Network:** Broadband Internet connection. It is highly recommended for your PC to be **hard-wired** into your router using an **ethernet cable**.
