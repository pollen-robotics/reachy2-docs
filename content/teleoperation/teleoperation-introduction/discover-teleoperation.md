## 🕹️ Introduction to the Reachy 2 Teleoperation Application

The **Reachy 2 Teleoperation App** lets you take **direct, real-time control** of the robot using **Virtual Reality (VR)**. It’s the most immersive way to explore what Reachy can do—and the closest experience to *being* the robot.

Whether you're guiding Reachy’s arms to grasp objects, looking around through its cameras, or remotely exploring an environment, this application turns you into Reachy's mind and eyes.


### Why Teleoperation?

Controlling a humanoid robot isn't just about programming—sometimes you want to **move intuitively**, explore interactions firsthand, or gather demonstrations for learning.

With the VR teleoperation app, you can:
- 🦾 Move Reachy’s arms and head naturally using your own movements  
- 👁️ See through Reachy’s stereo cameras for full environmental awareness  
- 🤝 Interact with real-world objects via the gripper and base  
- 🧠 Generate demonstration data for imitation learning or training intelligent behaviors


### What you'll need

To use the teleoperation app, you'll need:
- A **VR headset**  with **hand controllers** (see [compatible devices]({{< ref "teleoperation/compatibility-specs/compatible-devices" >}}))  
- A **network connection** between the robot and your computer  
- The **Reachy 2 teleoperation application** ([we’ll guide you through setup!]({{< ref "teleoperation/getting-started-teleoperation/installation" >}}))


### What can you do with it?

- Remote **object manipulation**  
- Live **human-in-the-loop interactions**  
- Performing complex tasks that are hard to script  
- Creating real-world datasets for **machine learning**
