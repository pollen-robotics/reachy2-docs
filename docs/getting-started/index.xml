You will then be able to choose another network using the dashboard.
Hard-wired connection #
Use an ethernet cable to connect your robot to the network.
The ethernet plug is available at position (b) on Reachyâ€™s hardware interface.
The computer inside Reachy is configured to use DHCP. It should thus be directly accessible on your network.</description></item><item><title>Connect to the dashboard</title><link>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/docs/getting-started/dashboard/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Aug 2023 14:43:48 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/docs/getting-started/dashboard/</guid><description>The dashboard is here to give you an overview of the robot&amp;rsquo;s state (what services are running, is there an error on a motor,&amp;hellip;) and give you the possibility to access quickly some features (changing a robot&amp;rsquo;s part compliance for example).
This tool has been thought to help you start easier with the robot and facilitate quick debugging.
