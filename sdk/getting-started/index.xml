Turning on/off the motors #
If at anytime when you&amp;rsquo;re working with Reachy you feel that you&amp;rsquo;re losing control of the robot&amp;rsquo;s movements, don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to turn the motors off. Use the switch button placed in its back.
Also, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to turn the motors off when you&amp;rsquo;re done working with the robot.</description></item><item><title>Installation</title><link>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/sdk/getting-started/install/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 18:50:10 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/sdk/getting-started/install/</guid><description>How to install the Python SDK #
The Python SDK is a pure Python library. The installation should thus be rather straightforward. It supports Python &amp;gt;= 3.10 (older versions will not work because of typing syntax). It works on Windows/Mac/Linux.
We recommend to use virtual environment for your development. They make the installation simple and avoid compatibility issues. They also come with their pip command.
From PyPi #
pip3 install reachy-sdk
From the source #
git clone https://github.</description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/sdk/getting-started/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 18:50:04 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/sdk/getting-started/hello-world/</guid><description>Enable cameras for the SDK #
SR camera #
The SR camera is unplugged by default.
If you want to use it, plug the SR camera on the robot&amp;rsquo;s computer remaining USB port (2).
Make sure to unplug it if you want to use the teleoperation.
Teleop cameras #
The teleop cameras are shared between the teleop service and the SDK server, and can only be used by one at the same time.</description></item><item><title>Connect to Reachy 2</title><link>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/sdk/getting-started/connect/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 18:49:56 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/sdk/getting-started/connect/</guid><description>The last required step before being able to use your Reachy 2 is to find its IP address.
Note: if you haven&amp;rsquo;t connected Reachy to a network yet, please first follow the instructions ???
Using the LCD screen #
If you haven&amp;rsquo;t unplugged it, the LCD screen connected in Reachy&amp;rsquo;s back should be diplaying its IP address.
If the LCD screen is not working or is unplugged, check out the page Find my IP section to learn other ways to get the IP address.</description></item><item><title>SDK Overview</title><link>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/sdk/getting-started/overview/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2023 18:49:56 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/sdk/getting-started/overview/</guid><description>Understand the SDK structure #
Reachy #
Parts #
Actuators #
Reachy&amp;rsquo;s arm offers 7 degrees of freedom. It also gives access to one joint for the gripper.
The arm is divided as follow:
shoulder, composed of 2 joints (pitch and roll) elbow, composed of 2 joints (yaw and pitch) wrist, composed of 3 joints (roll, pitch and yaw) We refer to the shoulder, elbow and wrist as actuators.
For some actions, such as changing the compliance, is the the lowest level of control you will have.</description></item></channel></rss>
