It is useful when you just want to use our Python SDK without having to worry about running by hand Reachy&amp;rsquo;s core ROS code. Nevertheless, you may want to use Reachy differently and deactivate them.
We use system.d to handle the services. If you are not familiar with this system, you should refer to the official documentation.</description></item><item><title>Manage Reachy's services</title><link>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/advanced/services/manage-services/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 08:05:33 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/advanced/services/manage-services/</guid><description>Use the dashboard! #
Each Reachy&amp;rsquo;s service appear in the services page of the dashboard. A card is created for each service with three buttons: restart (to restart the service), stop (to stop it) and show logs (to have acces to the status of the service and check what is happening, useful for debug). Using the dashboard is the easiest way to manage Reachy&amp;rsquo;s services.
ðŸ’¡ A card will be created for one of Reachy&amp;rsquo;s services only if the service is enabled.</description></item></channel></rss>
