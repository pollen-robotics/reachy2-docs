Even though there is little chance that you get hurt using Reachy, you might get surprised by its movements, especially the first times.
We recommend that you move both Reachy&amp;rsquo;s arms with your hands before you start programming it. The goal is that you get a sense of Reachy&amp;rsquo;s working space, the positions it can reach so that you won&amp;rsquo;t get hit when you actually send it commands.</description></item><item><title>Use the mobile base properly</title><link>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/advanced/safety/mobile-base/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Jul 2023 08:05:05 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://doks-child-theme.netlify.app/advanced/safety/mobile-base/</guid><description>Basic mouvements #
We recommend that you get a feel for the inertia of the robot by holding on to the metal pole and pushing and pulling it.
Block a wheel with your foot and try to gently tilt the robot.
Then use the controller to move around the robot as explained in Moving the mobile base
